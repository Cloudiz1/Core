## stdvec

introduces C++ inpsired vectors into C <br>
TODO:
- all of input validation and maybe some sort of primitary error handling (will likely end up just exiting lol)
- `vpop()`
- `vpop()` equivalent for the first element
- a way to build typecasting into the lib with enums would be nice 
    - because `*(type *)vget(vec *, size_t i)` is NOT the play
- slices? literally no clue how youd make it tho (i'd want them to be actual C arrays)
- printing functions would also be nice

## stdstr

would like to introduce C++ inspired strings into C <br>
big features:
- keep as close to `char *` as possible
- all the features of `std::String` from C++
- and if there needs to be an abstraction (which there likely will), have a seamless way to transition back into `char *`

## other future ideas:
honestly im not completely sure. Hashmaps would be cool but idk if its practical.
